CO2Meter - Carbon Footprint Dashboard (Prototype)
Hey there! 👋 This is a simple dashboard I built to explore how we might track digital carbon footprints. Right now it's just the visual interface - think of it like a "mockup" that shows what the final product could look like.

What Works Right Now
🌿 Nice looking interface with earthy green colors
📱 Works on phones and computers (try resizing your browser)
💡 Basic layout with navigation and placeholders for charts

What It Can't Do Yet
⚠️ No real data - Those numbers are just examples
⚠️ Buttons don't work - The toggle switch looks cool but doesn't actually do anything
⚠️ Charts are fake - The "Activity Breakdown" area is just an empty box

For Developers
If you peek at the code, you'll find:

Clean HTML structure

All styling done with CSS (no frameworks)

Simple responsive design

Placeholder comments where real functionality would go

Why I Built This
I wanted to create something that could eventually help people understand how their internet usage (like streaming videos or storing files in the cloud) impacts the environment. This version is just the starting point!
